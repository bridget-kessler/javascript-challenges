# Balanced Binary Search Tree

## The Challenge
Implement two classes: Tree, which builds a balanced binary tree when initialized with an array of numbers, and Node, which stores a value and references to its left/right children if they exist. Tree should have methods for breadth- and depth-first traversal, as well as calculating height and depth of a node in the tree.

## Definition of a Balanced Binary Tree
A tree is balanced if the difference between the respective heights of its left and right subtrees is no greater than 1.
